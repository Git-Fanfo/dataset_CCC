# Addressing the Diet Problem with Constraint Programming Enhanced with Machine Learning

## Abstract

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper titled "Addressing the Diet Problem with Constraint Programming Enhanced with Machine Learning." In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the diet problem, which involves finding an optimal diet plan that meets specific nutritional requirements while minimizing the cost of food items. Our method combines the power of constraint programming with machine learning techniques to efficiently tackle this complex optimization problem.
